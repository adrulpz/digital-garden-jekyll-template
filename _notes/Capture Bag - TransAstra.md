Included here as an ongoing ADR project using an inflatable capture bag—though recent diagrams make it look less like an inflatable. Still worth noting

----------
In 2023, **TransAstra** received a **contract** from NASA to build and test a **Capture Bag** for removing space debris. The inflatable bag, supported by struts to open and close, is designed to envelop noncooperative objects in orbit—like spinning satellites or rocket bodies—without needing docking or contact points. The idea builds on heritage from NASA’s Asteroid Redirect Mission and a smaller prototype TransAstra developed in 2021.

This method aims to collect multiple debris pieces in a single mission, reducing propellant needs and increasing efficiency. The bag could scale to objects ranging from CubeSats to large satellites and even asteroid

With **ThinkOrbital**, TransAstra proposes transporting captured debris to an **orbital recycling station** (the ThinkPlatform) instead of deorbiting everything. Their **simulation study** showed this approach could cut propellant costs by **82%**, time to clear debris by **40%**, and reduce total cleanup costs sixfold.

**Key Highlights:**

- In 2023 **TransAstra** secured a NASA contract for developing a **"Capture Bag"** to envelop and deorbit debris.
- The bag is based on technology originally used for asteroid capture.
- Enables collection of multiple debris pieces at once (reusable and potentially scalable).
- The method is designed to **deorbit debris safely** or **redirect it** for future resource use (like a recycling space centre )

According to [SpaceDaily](https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/TransAstra_to_showcase_Capture_Bag_on_ISS_in_2025_999.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com), TransAstra will demonstrate its Capture Bag technology on the ISS in late 2025, with CASIS co-funding half of the mission’s costs.

**CASIS** stands for the **Center for the Advancement of Science in Space**. It's a nonprofit organizationthat manages the U.S. National Laboratory on the International Space Station (ISS) on behalf of NASA.

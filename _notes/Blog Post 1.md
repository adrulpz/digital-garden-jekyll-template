#### Why did I waste my time trying to connect eduroam?

I decided to start using my Raspberry Pi, which I haven't used in about five years, as I thought it would be good practice to use a terminal again and have another SO without messing with my laptop. And since I had a new SD, why not install a new version instead of figuring out what I left there? First error, I installed a version without a desktop and tried to connect the raspberry to eduroam, the authentication was a nightmare, so I installed a light desktop version because it was mentioned that a Raspberry 3 has limited resources, and I finally realized that using other network was an option, like my hotspot ( it was so much easy to connect ).

Anyway, having installed the LXQt desktop, I was still trying to connect it to eduroam, adding this another day without any results as I got so confused I even deleted the WLAN option to connect and couldn't figure it out how to make it appear again. to this point I decided that the best way I could proceed was installing the desktop version of Ubuntu. I still can't connect it to Eduroam, and I still don't fully understand why it's so difficult to authenticate. Now, the problem I'm facing is that this version is so slow that I haven't tried to install ROS2, which was one of the main objectives. Currently, I'm exploring adding swap space to mitigate memory constraints, and I realize I don't have to spend my mobile data on this as I can use the QM-visitor network.

I'm almost sure I shouldn't spend so much time on this, but having started it, it feels necessary to have it configured and ready to use ROS whenever I want to retake it.

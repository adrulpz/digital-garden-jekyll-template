------------------
**Hook**
Imagine a future where a single fragment of metal, no larger than a coin, destroys an operational **satellite**. Now consider that there are over **36,000** of these fragments currently orbiting Earth, traveling at speeds exceeding **25,000 km/h**. This is the reality of space **debris**, and it represents a growing threat to the infrastructure we rely on daily.

---

**Problem**  
From **telecommunications** to **navigation** and **Earth observation**, our dependence on **satellite** services is increasing. At the same time, uncontrolled **debris accumulation** raises the risk of collisions, which generate even more fragments—accelerating a chain reaction known as the **Kessler Syndrome**. Without effective **mitigation** and removal strategies, critical **orbits** could become too hazardous for future operations.

---

Solution  
In my research, I focus on evaluating the potential of **inflatable robotic arms** for capturing space debris. These systems offer a lightweight and scalable alternative to traditional rigid mechanisms, with the flexibility to safely interact with **irregular** and fragile objects. Through **numerical simulations** and physical **prototyping** under relevant conditions, my work aims to assess the **feasibility** and performance of these structures, providing data to support their future use in **active debris removal**.

---

Impact  
While this research is at the **proof-of-concept** stage, understanding the capabilities and limitations of inflatable systems is essential for guiding future **orbital servicing missions**. By validating these technologies early, we can inform the design of scalable solutions that contribute to long-term space **sustainability**.

Closing
Addressing space debris requires both innovative concepts and realistic validation. Through targeted testing and simulation, we can take critical steps toward protecting the future of space operations.

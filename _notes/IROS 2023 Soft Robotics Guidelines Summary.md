[IROS 2023 Workshop Report: Draft Guidelines on Manufacturing Procedures, Test Methods and Reporting for Soft Robotic](https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1005&context=mewp)

This document captures a series of suggestions and optional preliminary guidelines for soft roboticists related to fabrication and manufacturing, testing methods, and documentation, which were collaboratively created during the workshop.

The common test methods that need established guidelines are:

1. **Stress vs Strain of Soft, Hyperelastic Materials**:
    - Specify the specimen gage length. ​
    - Define strain and stress (e.g., true versus engineering strain/stress). ​
2. **Cyclic Tensile Testing of Soft Materials**:
    - Establish guidelines for conducting cyclic tensile tests. ​
3. **Material Aging**:
    - Enforce controlled storage conditions such as temperature, humidity, and sunlight exposure. ​
    - Report storage conditions if control is not possible. ​
4. **Soft Robot Gripper Efficacy**:    
    - Adapt elements from traditional robotics, such as the Yale-CMU-Berkeley object and model set for evaluating gripper efficacy. ​
5. **Blocked Force Characterization of Soft Actuators**:
    - Develop guidelines for blocked force characterization of soft actuators. ​

These guidelines aim to standardize testing methods to ensure consistency and comparability across different studies and experiments in the field of soft robotics. ​
